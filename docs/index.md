# JournalGPG
This project was born out of the need for an encrypted journal that is able to be stored locally and provide plausible denaiblity for the encryption key. Many online platforms, such as [Penzu](https://penzu.com), [Journey](journey.cloud), [Goodnight Journal](https://www.goodnightjournal.com/), [journalate](https://myjournalate.com/) might provide the same functions but there is no guarentee that the entries you write won't be see by others as it is merely a suponea away from being captured or released reguardless if it the contents are said to be encrypted when using these platforms. 

If you read the terms and conditions, on some platforms you don't own the data and they are allowed to use it as they see fit. This does not bode well when the entires you're writing are meant to be your intermost private thoughts and feelings. Knowning this may also prevent you from expressing yourself in a healthier way and in a more freely fashion. 

In the creation of this project the goal is to provide a journal which is able to surivive the rapid changing of technology by storing the entires as plain text, to provide a journal which is local to your computer and encrypted using an offline key to provide better security. 

This code is primarly bash shell scripting, I thought about writing it in python but I'm more familar with bash scripts and I also wanted to further the goal of not needing much in the way of special software to use this script. Anyone should be able to stand up a very basic and limited linux system and begin writing in a journal using only a text editor and making use of bash and GnuPG.
